## Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species
##### Elon Musk (2017)

**Short Summary**: This (clearly) isn't an AI paper but a nice, not very technical transcript of a presentation Elon Musk made at the 67th International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, September 26â€“30, 2016. In February 2017, SpaceX announced it will launch a crewed mission beyond the moon for two private customers in late 2018. Elon reported that the plan since then has improved and been modified and is looking forward to putting out the v2 to this initial plan.

There are a fair number of details about the rocket itself but the main ideas of the paper are that we need ~1mil people on Mars for it to becoming a self-sustaining civilization and that in order to do so, we need people to want to and be able to move. To do this, the cost of each ride must be drastically reduced, from almost infinity at this moment to the cost of purchasing a small house. Elon lays out four major elements needed to reduce the cost to Mars by *5,000,000* percent:

1) Full reusability (rockets, thrusters, everything)
2) Refilling in orbit (fewer points of failure, don't need to store all fuel at once to escape gravity well, make it to Mars, and land)
3) Propellant production in Mars (need to make propellant there, otherwise, we won't get back)
4) The Right Propellant (deep-cryo methane seems to be the way to go, especially since it's the easiest to make on Mars)

There are more high level details of the power of the Raptor engine and rocket boosters necessary to get to Mars (compared to Saturn V) as well as large logistical issues of getting to Mars (can only happen once every two years, need a fleet of hundreds of ships to leave Earth at once to be economical, etc.)

Overall, this paper is probably more interesting for those versed in aeronautics and space travel, but it's an incredible read into the mind of someone who truly wants to colonize Mars and is thinking decades ahead of his time now. For people who look up to Elon Musk (like me), the question remains -- could I feasible think, operate, and execute on this scale and convince those around me to take my word? #goals
